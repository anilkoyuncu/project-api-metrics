# Project Api Metrics

This repo contains a few Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that query the
GitHub API to gather metrics related to project health and other activities.

I am also using this repo as I learn how to use the GitHub GraphQL API.

The [scripts](scripts/) directory contains the scripts and more information
about how to run them.

The [notebooks](notebooks/) directory contains Jupyter notebooks that allow
you to explore the data gathered from the API.
