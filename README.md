# Project Api Metrics

This repo contains a few Python scripts that query the GitHub API to gather
metrics related to project health and other activities.

I am also using this repo as I learn how to use the GitHub GraphQL API.

## GraphQL API Scripts

The [scripts](scripts/) directory contains the scripts and more information
about how to run them.
