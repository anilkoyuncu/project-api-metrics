# Python Scripts

These Python 3 scripts use the GitHub APIs to gather data.

The scripts all have a few common requirements, and individual
scripts may have additional requirements and other information
which can be found in the Docstrings.

Requirements:

* These scripts require that `pandas` be installed within the Python
  environment you are running this script in.
* Your API key should be stored in a file called gh_key in the
  same folder as these scripts.
* Most scripts require that a folder named "output" exists in this
  scripts directory, and csv output files will be stored there.
