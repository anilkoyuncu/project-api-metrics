# Project API Metrics Jupyter Notebooks

This is where I experiment with ideas or troubleshoot issues.

These Jupyter Notebooks may not be very interesting, since
the things that work will be converted into scripts in the 
[scripts](../scripts) directory.

However, I'm putting the notebooks in the repo, so that anyone
who wants to have a closer look at the dataframes and other
output can poke around and possibly customize them for your needs.

These notebooks might also be useful for people who are more
comfortable using Jupyter notebooks than running scripts.
