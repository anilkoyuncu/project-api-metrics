# Project API Metrics Jupyter Notebooks

This is where I experiment with ideas, troubleshoot issues,
or explore data.

Some of these notebooks have also been converted into scripts
in the [scripts](../scripts) directory.

The advantage of the notebooks is that you can have a closer look 
at the dataframes and other output to poke around and customize
them for your needs.

These notebooks might also be useful for people who are more
comfortable using Jupyter notebooks than running scripts.
